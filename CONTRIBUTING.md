# Bugs

## Where to Find Known Issues

We will be using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. We will keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem was not reported by someone else in other issue.

## Reporting New Issues

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case explaining how to reproduce the bug.
